# Homework 1 by Susanna Klassen

Welcome one and all to my first homework assignment (hw01)!

##About me

I am a first year PhD Student at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability. My research looks at how we can create more sustainable agri-food systems in Canada, specifically looking at the social and environmental performance of organic agriculture. 

I'm excited to be learning how to wrangle data so that I can apply it to my project!
