# Homework 1 by Susanna Klassen

Welcome one and all to my first homework assignment (hw01)!

## About me

I am a first year PhD Student at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability. My research looks at how we can create more sustainable agri-food systems in Canada, specifically looking at the social and environmental performance of organic agriculture. 

I'm excited to be learning how to wrangle data so that I can apply it to my project!

## A note about process

As much as possible, I edited this README.md file using markdown in RStudio. My general process followed this format:
1. Make a small number of changes/additions 
    - e.g. adding a new header and associated section with one new markdown feature such as a list)
2. Save these changes as I go along
3. Pull changes from Github (purely for good form)
4. Commit recently saved changes to my local repo
    - with a note to describe the change
5. Push the commit 'up' to Github repo
